DTB2iTunes is a program used to combine all of the audio files of a Digital talking book into a single mp3 file or iTune Audiobook fromat and upload it to your iTunes or other MP3 application.

It is assumed that the DAISY DTB mp3 files are named in such a way that they will come together in order, are in MP3 format and are not encrypted in any way.

Daisy DTB produced by DTBMaker 2.0  will be named in this way. Other Daisy DTB may be this way as well. Daisy DTB mp3 files produced by Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic and the National Library Service are not in page order and this program will not work for them.

A new feature in DTB2iTunes is that it will now attempt to read a chpatertool.xml file if one is included with the book. If one is found DTB2iTune will use it to mark all the navigation points in the book into the audio book created. The current version of DTBmaker for Macintosh will create a chaptertool.xml file each time it produces a book. This permits uses to jump to any navigation point in the audiobook file when used on an iPod.
